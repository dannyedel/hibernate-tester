This is the protocol that server (testrunner) and client (device under test)
should speak to each other.

Ideally, we'd implement some kind of error-checking in case they dont...
Note that it is always the client that opens a TCP connection, and the
connections are very short lived. The server is supposed to keep the state
somewhere.

Rationale: If we leave the connection open, and the client goes to sleep, the
server's OS might kill the connection (keepalives) or increase any timeouts
so much, that the connection would wait for hours before attempting a new
packet - even if the client is up again.

Still to be determined: TCP ports in use.

> means client sends to server
< means server replies to client
All commands are terminated by newline

1: Download service

> DOWNLOAD
< [a full /bin/bash script that executes the client side]

2.1: Ask the server which module to load

> LOADWHAT
< [single module name to load]

NOTE: If the server replies with an empty line, client quits program. Success.

2.2: Now the client will modprobe the module and tell the server what is now
loaded

> LOADED
> [/proc/modules]

2.3: Client tries to hibernate

echo reboot > /sys/power/disk
echo disk > /sys/power/state

2.4 If we wake up again, we know those modules work, so tell that to the server

> KNOWNGOOD
> [proc/modules]

Now go back to 2.1
